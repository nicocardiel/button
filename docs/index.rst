Welcome to button's documentation!
==================================

**Button** is a Fortran library created by Nicol√°s Cardiel with the aim of
using graphical buttons with `PGPLOT
<http://www.astro.caltech.edu/~tjp/pgplot/>`_.
The code was imitially developed in Fortran 77, although some minor changes
have been introduced (January 2023) to compile it as Fortran 90 code (without
trying to make full use of the advantages of Fortran 90).
